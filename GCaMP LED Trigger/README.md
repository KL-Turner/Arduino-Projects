# GCaMP-Arduino-Codes
Flashes alternating blue/green LEDs triggered by a square wave TTL pulse via a waveform generator. The blue LEDs are used to excite Thy1-GCaMP6f in the cortex, which fluoresces green light upwards that a camera records as an analog for neural activity. In-between the 'blue-excited' green frames of the camera, the green LEDs shine down and the light is reflected back up to the same camera as a measurement of blood volume. Changes in the amount of light reflected during these frames reflect the ratiomentric changes in total hemoglobin as vessels dilate and constrict. The LEDs and corresponding camera frames must be alternated as both of the recorded signals of interest are green, which would contaminate both signals and thus render the measurement useless.
